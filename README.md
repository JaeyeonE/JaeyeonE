# ✨ Hi, I'm JaeyeonE

I am a developer with strong curiosity and a passion for turning ideas into working systems.
I started my journey with **Flutter-based frontend development** and gradually shifted my focus to **Python-centered AI systems**, particularly **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Computer Vision** for object detection and real-time perception.

Recently, I have been expanding my interests toward **robotics software and intelligent control systems**, aiming to bridge AI models with real-world, physical environments.
